				<p>This project focuses on analyzing the population of cities in the United States, examining population
					growth, density, and geographic distribution according to the size and status of each city. The data
					was collected through web scraping and enriched with information from recent censuses and estimates,
					allowing an updated perspective on how the size and role of a city influence its growth dynamics.
				</p>

				<h2 class="no-margin">Goals</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Analyze population growth trends in major U.S. cities.</li>
					<li>Explore how population density varies across states and city categories.</li>
					<li>Compare changes in population density and growth across regions.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2 class="no-margin">Methodology</h2>
				<p class="no-margin">
				<ol>
					<li>Data Collection (Web Scraping)</li>
					I used BeautifulSoup and Requests to extract data from the Wikipedia page on the largest cities in
					the United States by population. This phase involved identifying and extracting the relevant table
					and creating a DataFrame with specific columns such as "City," "ST," "2023 Estimate," among others.
					The most difficult part of this phase, in my opinion, was the extraction of the categories for each
					city, since in Wikipedia they are differentiated by color.
					<li>Data Preprocessing</li>
					<ul class="no-margin">
						<li>Delete Duplicates: Duplicate rows were removed to ensure data integrity.</li>
						<li>Text Cleanup: Regex was used to remove unnecessary characters such as brackets in city
							names.</li>
						<li>Data Standardization: Column values ​​were adjusted to display only two decimal places and
							consistent formats were applied across all columns.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</li>
					<ul class="no-margin">
						<li>Descriptive Statistics: General statistics such as the mean and maximum of the estimated
							population for 2023 were analyzed.</li>
						<li>Visualization of Correlations: A correlation heatmap was generated between the numerical
							variables of the data set.</li>
						<li>Classification of Cities: The cities with the highest population growth, the highest
							estimated population in 2023, and the highest population density were analyzed.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Created visualisations</li>
					Graphs generated with Seaborn and Matplotlib were used to illustrate the distribution and
					relationship between variables, such as correlations and population density.
				</ol>

				<h2 class="no-margin">Tools Used</h2>
				<p class="no-margin">
				<ul>
					<li>Python and Pandas: for data cleaning and preprocessing.</li>
					<li>BeautifulSoup and Requests: for extracting data from the website.</li>
					<li>Seaborn and Matplotlib: for data visualizations in the exploratory data analysis.</li>
					<li>Tableau: for creating interactive visualizations that show key insights from the population.
					</li>
				</ul>
				</p>

				<h2 class="no-margin">Analysis</h2>
				<p class="no-margin">The analysis revealed several important findings:
				<ul>
					<li>Density Distribution: States with the highest population density include California and
						Texas,
						with dense urban areas being particularly prominent. The State Density visualization on the
						dashboard reflects these patterns.</li>
					<li>Population Growth by City Category: Cities classified as capitals or the largest in the
						state
						tend to show higher percentages of population change compared to other cities. This can be
						seen
						in the Population Change by City chart, where cities like Jackson and Sioux Falls have
						-6.50%
						and
						+7.22% respectively, so the population in Jackson decreased while Sioux Falls increased.
					</li>
					<li>Geographic Impact: Western states, like Washington, show significant growth compared to some
						areas in the Midwest, suggesting that geographic and economic factors contribute to these
						differences in growth.</li>
				</ul>
				</p>

				<h2 class="no-margin">Conclusions</h2>
				<p class="no-margin">This analysis has revealed significant variations in growth and density
					patterns,
					which are largely dependent on the status and location of each city. Cities that serve as state
					capitals or are the largest in the state tend to grow at higher rates compared to other cities
					of
					lesser administrative importance. Geographic and economic factors have also been shown to
					influence
					growth dynamics, with western states such as California exhibiting higher population growth than
					some midwestern states.

					These observations are relevant to urban planning and decision-making in the local development
					arena, as policymakers can tailor their strategies based on these regional and urban
					differences.
					The visualizations developed in Tableau have made it possible to effectively explore and
					communicate
					density and growth patterns, highlighting how each category of city contributes to the current
					population configuration of the United States. This information provides a solid foundation for
					understanding demographic trends and their impact on the development of urban areas in the
					country.
